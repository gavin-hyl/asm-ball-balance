Problems:
1. file headers need more detail
    - revision history
    - list functions
    - local functions as well
2. function headers
    - is called vs. expected to be called
    - list actual variables
3. inline comments!
4. no code duplication
5. remove stack depth
6. main should include functional specs
7. valid range of function inputs

8. Source and sink

questions:
1. constant arithmetic??
2. what constitutes local variables
