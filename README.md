## Course Description (Caltech Catalog [2023-24](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/eecs-10-ab))

This course is intended to give the student a basic understanding of the major
hardware and software principles involved in the specification and design of
embedded systems. The course will cover basic digital logic, programmable logic
devices, CPU and embedded system architecture, and embedded systems programming
principles (interfacing to hardware, events, user interfaces, and multi-tasking).

(Description applies to both 10a and 10b, please refer to [this] repo for 10a).

## Project Description

THe system constructed was a balance game, where the user tilts the game board
